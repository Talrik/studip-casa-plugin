==================

Plugin for Stud.IP using Context Aware Service Access (CASA) 

Description
-----------

This plugin enables the user to connect his lectures with relevant services. These services 
are then embedded as websites within the sites of the lectures. Additionally it is also 
possible to connect services with the location of the events. Using the role model of Stud.IP 
it is also possible to restrict the access to the services. 

There are two ways to use this plugin: 

*   Standalone

    Without a CASA server the plugin allows only static bindings between services and lectures/locations. 
Therefore, you will only be able to connect to services which are entered in the Stud.IP system.

*   Connected to a CASA server

    By using a CASA server you are able to use also context information from other sources like OpenStreetMap, 
Facebook or whatever you would like. Therefore, services can be connected dynamically based on location, time, 
activity and identity of the user.
